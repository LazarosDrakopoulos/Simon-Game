# Simon-Game-Challenge

The 'Simon' project is a web-based implementation of the famous Simon electronic game, completed during a Udemy course. Constructed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, the game challenges players to replicate color sequences generated by the system. The interface features four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) representing the game's cues. Players must remember and repeat the sequence correctly to progress to the next level.
